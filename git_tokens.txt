Github recommends you use Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) to remember your credentials.

Instead of manually entering your PAT for every HTTPS Git operation, you can cache 
your PAT with a Git client. Git will temporarily store your credentials in memory 
until an expiry interval has passed. You can also store the token in a plain text 
file that Git can read before every request.

The installations instructions can be found in the github README.md.

Use libsecret. If it's not already pre-installed on your machine, use the following
procedure:

Make sure libsecret is installed:

    sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev

Then build the credential helper from the sources shipped with libsecret's 
development libraries:

    sudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret

Finally, register the freshly compiled binary as a Git credential helper:

    git config --global credential.helper \
       /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret

So, if you download a private repository and put your PAT instead of your password, 
git will store it securely on your computer.

So, to view your PAT you can use secret-tool following the procedure:

Make sure secret-tools is installed:

    sudo apt install libsecret-tools

secret-tool stores credentials based on key/value pairs. So, you can show your PAT 
looking for credential associated with github.com server.

    secret-tool lookup server github.com
