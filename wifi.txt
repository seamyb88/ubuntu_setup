Wifi Speed was very slow. Corrected by two different things.

1. Fix the bug in Debian Avahi-daemon

The slow WiFi in Ubuntu problem could also be related to a bug in Avahi-daemon of 
Debian. 
Ubuntu and many other Linux distribution are based on Debian so this bug propagates
to these Linux distributions as well.

To fix this bug, you have to edit the nsswitch configuration file. Open a terminal 
and use the following command:

sudo nvim /etc/nsswitch.conf

This will open the configuration file in gedit so that you could edit it easily in 
GUI. 
look for the following line:

hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4

If you find this file, replace it with the following line:

hosts:          files dns

Save it, close it, restart your computer. It should fix the slow wireless connection 
problem for you. 


2.

sudo nvim /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf

Then changed the value from 3 to 2, saved changes and rebooted.
